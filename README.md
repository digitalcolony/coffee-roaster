# Coffee Roaster Map

The webpage was built using React and the react-usa-map npm package.

The states array is updated every time I order coffee from a new state. Each state in the array is filled in on the map. The goal is order coffee from every state and DC.

[Coffee Roasters - Mail Order Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h-oqlqJ_G3UXuDSkdFHuEaCVuOXQOb68y2sduXQRTn4/edit?usp=sharing)

At some point, I'll pull the states directly from the Google Sheet, but for now, I'll update the array by hand.
